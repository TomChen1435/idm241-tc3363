# Case Study

## Hero Image

## Overview

This the executive summary of your case study. It allows your prospects to quickly understand the highlights of your past work without reading the entire thing. This section should include the core takeaways from all other sections including the main problem, an overview of the solution, and key results. This is typically written last, so that you can scan for the main points from each section below and summarize them into a one or two paragraph synopsis.

## Context and Challenge

This section is designed to provide your prospective client with a detailed description of the context that led to the creation of the project, and can be distilled into three main elements:

1. Background / Description / Timeline / Budget / Purpose
2. The Problem: Define why this project exists and what problem it seeks to solve.
3. Goals & Objectives: What are the metrics that will define if this project is successful. What are the tangible goals.

Give a quick overview of the project. What were the goals for the project. Keep the focus on problem-solving, not just asset delivery. Define if it was a solo or team based project. If team based, what your role was on the project.

## Process and Insight

This section should elaborate on your design process. How did you go about developing the final solution. What were the steps that will help the reader to visualize the work and, more importantly, to see that it was created by human beings. We want see how the final came into being, not just what the piece looks like at the end. These could include (but not limited to) research:

* Target Audience / User Personas
* User Journeys
* Design Sketches
* Wireframes
* Style Guide
* Prototypes
* Code/Dev
* UX Testing Notes
* Final Project

If this was a team based project, make sure to define your specific contributions to the project. When was there team consensus, and what were you specifically responsible for. Be sure to include images / video for each stage of the process as appropriate.

## Solution

This is where you get to show off your final design with detailed images and videos, and a link to the live project if available. Describe your design work. Take the time to explain in detail your site’s defining features like its UX, navigation structure, content strategy, or unique mobile attributes. If you put the effort into crafting descriptions that complement your visual assets, your readers will feel much more confident in your decisions as a designer/developer.

## Results

A quick wrap up. Was the project a success and why. Do you have qualitative and quantitative success metrics from your project? These should directly address the objectives you established in The Context and Challenge section. If this is client work, include a client testimonial. This also is an opportunity to define the lessons learned and what you would change about your process / approach in the future.
